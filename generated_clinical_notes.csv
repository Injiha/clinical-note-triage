**Physical Examination**:  
- Vitals: BP 128/80, HR 72, RR 18, Temp 98.1°F

**Laboratory and Imaging Studies**:  
- Recent CBC and CMP within normal limits

**Assessment**:  
1. Small cell lung cancer, limited stage, post-treatment  
2. Hypertension, well-controlled  
3. Hyperlipidemia, stable  
4. Osteoarthritis, symptomatic management

**Plan**:  
1. Continue monitoring SCLC with follow-up PET scan next month; consider MRI of brain to rule out CNS involvement as standard after initial treatment.  
2. Supportive care: Encourage small, frequent meals; continue dietary supplements to support weight gain and energy levels.  
3. Address fatigue with gentle physical activity as tolerated; evaluate further if it persists.  
4. Maintain current medication regimen for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  
5. Follow up in Oncology Clinic in 1 month or sooner if symptoms worsen.

**Patient Education and Counseling**:  
Discussed treatment outcomes and expectations. Reinforced importance of follow-up and symptom monitoring. Patient and family expressed understanding.

**Medical Record Number:** [MRN]  
**Date of Birth:** [DOB]  
**Age:** 58  
**Gender:** Other  
**Date:** [Today's Date]

**Subjective:**

The patient is a 58-year-old with a recent diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Presented to the clinic today for follow-up after an initial diagnosis confirmed via CT scan and biopsy from the right upper lobe.

- **Chief Complaint:** Shortness of breath and persistent cough.
- **HPI:** The patient reports increased fatigue and dyspnea on exertion over the past 2 weeks. The cough is productive, with occasional hemoptysis. Reports a weight loss of approximately 10 lbs in the last 6 weeks, and loss of appetite. No fevers, but some night sweats are present. Denies chest pain or palpitations.

- **FH:** No family history of cancer.  
- **SH:** Lives alone, support from family. Not currently employed. Social drinking, no drug use.

**Objective:**

- **Vitals:** BP 130/85, HR 90, RR 20, Temp 98.6°F, SpO2 92% on room air.

- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
- **Extremities:** No clubbing or cyanosis, mild peripheral edema.
- **Skin:** No rashes or lesions.

**Assessment:**

1. **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):** Stage to be determined post-PET scan.  
2. Dyspnea and cough - likely secondary to primary lung tumor.  
3. Weight loss and night sweats - concerning for systemic involvement or chemotherapy side effects.

**Plan:**

- **Diagnostics:**
  - Schedule PET scan to assess for metastasis.
  - CBC, CMP to monitor for paraneoplastic syndromes.

- **Therapeutics:**
  - Start chemotherapy regimen with Etoposide and Cisplatin (EP regimen).
  - Consider adding radiation therapy following oncology consultation.
  - Prescribe albuterol inhaler PRN for dyspnea relief.

- **Symptom Management:**
  - Recommend high-calorie nutritional supplements to address weight loss.
  - Referral to oncology dietitian for dietary support.
  - Encourage hydration and rest.

- **Follow up:**
  - Appointment with medical oncology within 1 week.
  - Reassess symptomatology and treatment tolerance in follow-up.

**Counseling:**
Discussed diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis with the patient. Patient expressed understanding and willingness to proceed with recommended therapy plan. Provided educational materials on SCLC.
